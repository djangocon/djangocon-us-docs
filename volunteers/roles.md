> The Django Circus people definitely did an outstanding job. Unfortunately I was pushing most the announcements and with a three day conference it took me a few days to figure out what I should even be posting. In the future with some organization then it should be straight forward but again, I'd love for someone to own this and coordinate it with a plan.

### Website and Technical Lead

Responsible for developing the public web presence for the conference, and maintaining any tools necessary to support the publicity and program chairs.

### Graphics Lead

This might be a shared role or just part of the Conference Chair position. I already have a few speakers in mind but before I test the waters I want to see which way we are leaning.
