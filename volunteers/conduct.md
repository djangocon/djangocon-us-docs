## Notes 

### "I don't like that you have a Code of Conduct"

We sometimes get complaints about having a Code of Conduct at all. We respond this way: 

> Thank you for contacting us. A Code of Conduct helps us be prepared in case the unforeseeable happens. We have a Code of Conduct and post local emergency numbers on our website because we care about our attendees' well-being. 

> As the Django Code of Conduct states, "This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate." -- [Django's Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/). I would highly recommend you check it out Django's Code of Conduct because every Django-related event follows something very similar. 

> If you have purchased a ticket and you are bothered by our inclusion of a CoC then I am more than happy to refund your ticket. 

### Complaints that aren't violations

Sometimes people report something as a Code of Conduct violation that doesn't violate the Code of Conduct.

For a complaint where the reporter isn't sure if an action violates the Code of Conduct, we respond this way: 

> Thank you for reporting this to the Code of Conduct Committee. We appreciate you taking the time to let us know. 

> We have determined that [action] did not violate the Code of Conduct. We want to encourage you to report any experience that you have a question about. We are always here to take a report or answer questions. 

For a complaint about "reverse racism/sexism" (example: a speaker refers to the abundance of straight white men in the industry someone takes offense), we respond this way: 

> Our aim at DjangoCon US is to create an inclusive, welcoming environment for all of our attendees. We're disappointed to hear that [event] made you feel [feeling]. That was not our intent. 

> It is never our wish that an attendee feel excluded; however, our organizers have concluded that [action] did not violate the Code of Conduct. 

> Thank you for your report. We sincerely hope that you are able to have a great experience for the rest of the conference.
