organized and run by volunteers from the Python and Django community.\nWant to help run DjangoCon US? Say hello!\nWe'll chat with you about how you'd like to contribute, then add you to our mailing list, Slack workspace, and Trello board so you can get started. \nCode of Conduct\nAs a contributor, you can help us keep the Django community open and inclusive.\nPlease read and follow our Code of Conduct.\nTo run Gitbook locally:\n\nFork this repository \nClone it to your machine \nRun gitbook install \nRun gitbook serve \nView in browser at http://localhost:4000\n\n"},"planning/":{"url":"planning/","title":"Planning and Schedule","keywords":"","body":"DjangoCon Guidelines\nAbout organizing DjangoCon US\nSome areas of responsibility come into play very early in the planning process. A website lead is needed very early on, for example. Other areas of responsibility only come into play at the conference itself, such as the registration coordinator. The conference chair(s) are selected very early in the process.  \nThe list of responsibilities for each area is meant to be comprehensive, but not necessarily exhaustive. Other to-do items will come up in the planning process; every year is different. All organizers are free to help other areas as needed; organizers are not territorial about their areas. \nThe Django Software Foundation has published guidelines for hosting an event that is branded \"DjangoCon.\"\nThe guidelines in this GitBook are specific to DjangoCon US, which is a two-track conference that takes place over six days in North America. \nSome unpublished rules about hosting a DjangoCon will vary depending on the location of the DjangoCon; for example, in the United States, we are required to host our event a specific amount of time away from PyCon US and DjangoCon Europe. If you would like to host a DjangoCon or another Django event, please contact the DSF for more information.\nConference Schedule\nThe Code of Conduct covers all conference events, including those hosted by sponsors \nConference Days (All Days)\nContinental breakfast and lunch offered. Snacks are optional, but desirable.\nTutorials (1 Day)\n\n2-3 rooms, setup classroom style (2-3 tutorials in the morning, and 2-3 in the afternoon)\nEach with projector, microphone, and power strips for attendees to plug into \nDepending on number of rooms available, 75-200 people expected\n\nTalks (3 Days)\n\nExpected attendance: 450-500\nMorning starts with a keynote in one large room (if possible, book a spillover room with streaming of the keynote)\nFor rest of day, two rooms setup theater or classroom style are desirable, to provide two presentation tracks. (If venue cannot provide two rooms, one track is an acceptable alternative.)\nProjector and at least one microphone needed per room. \nIf a panel is scheduled, make more chairs and more microphones available. \nProvide power cords and extra dongles for various laptop-to-video outputs for presenters.\nProvide power strips in audience for attendees. \n\nSprint Days (2 Days)\n\nExpected attendance: 150 - 200.\nCan book sprint venue at the same venue as the rest of the conference, but this will be the most expensive option for catering\nCan book sprint venue at an alternate venue (possibly a local tech company or coworking space will donate their space). This can be less expensive for catering, but may require attendees to travel from the hotel.\n\nOptional Events\nNewcomer Orientation\n\nCost: free \nSchedule the evening after tutorials, or the first day of talks before the keynote \nPresentation that lasts about 30-60 minutes and covers: \nCode of Conduct \nImpostor syndrome \nSelf care, using the quiet room, trying to exercise the extrovert muscle \n\n\n\nWelcome Reception\n\nCost: Free if sponsored, $5,000-10,000 if not \nSchedule on the evening of the first talks day \nCan be sponsored by one or more sponsors, or can be hosted by the main conference. \nAdd the event to the schedule and promote it \nWe require that the event not provide free alcohol, but it can be held in a place where people can purchase their own alcoholic beveraes \nWe ask that light appetizers be served \nWe ask that the event be held in a place where consumption of alcohol isn't the main activity (bowling alley, arcade, mini golf, etc.)\nExpected attendance: about 70% of the attendees\n\nSpeaker Dinner\n\nCost: Free if sponsored; varies depending on event type otherwise \nSchedule on the evening of the tutorials day, or the second or third talks day (to not conflict with opening reception)\nSame rules as welcome reception with regard to venue, alcohol\nInvite tutorial presenters, keynote speakers, speakers, panelists and panel moderators, organizers\nExpected attendance: 85-90% of the invitees\n\nBoard Game Night\n\nCost: usually free, or the cost of an extra meeting room for a few hours \nBook an extra room at the venue on the second or third evening of the conference from when the last talk ends to 9:00 or 10:00 pm \nAdd to conference schedule and publicize \nPeople bring their own board games; this is a self-managing event for the most part. \n\nDjango Girls Workshop\n\nCost: Free for the conference, unless we choose to sponsor \nExpected attendance: 40-50 attendees, 10-15 coaches \nIs organized by a local team with separate sponsorship and separate budgets from the main conference, but coordinates with the main conference so we can help if possible. \nMay be able to use same venue as the conference or piggyback on our food order; this is very budget-dependent. \nMay use an entirely different venue and catering, but cross-promote with our conference \nExplore offering deeply discounted or free conference tickets to workshop attendees; historically, only a small percentage of workshop attendees wish to attend the full conference, so this is generally not a large cost \n\nOther Sponsor Events\n\nCost: Free for the conference\nAt sponsor discretion \nMay include an evening event that they ask us to promote but we are not involved in (2018 Mini-Golf with Caktus), or a hosted lunch (2018's Women and Non-Binary Luncheon hosted by Microsoft Azuere Advocates) at the venue that we help them coordinate with venue staff but they fund. \n\n"},"venue/":{"url":"venue/","title":"Venue","keywords":"","body":"Venue\nTeam size: 1-2 \nResponsibilities: pre-conference\n\nEnsure room allocation sheet is created, which outlines the venue rooms we have access to for each day \nReview event orders from venue with a very detailed eye; review for things like power needs, meal setups, proper number of rooms, etc. \nBook special meals with catering for those with dietary restrictions \nMake sure hotel labels meals with allergens \\\nFamiliarize themselves with the venue contract \nStay updated on hotel booking information \nContact venue to increase hotel block size as needed\nAssist Diversity and Outreach with getting accessibility information about the venue \nBe primary venue contact prior to the conference, and on-site during the conference\n\nResponsibilities: at the conference\n\nConduct site inspection at the venue, making sure presentation rooms and other rooms are delivered as contracted \nMake sure meals are adequately labeled \n\nSpace needed\n\nOrganizer room - meeting room \nSpeaker green room - meeting room \nQuiet room - meeting room\n(Possible) Nursing room - meeting room preferably with no windows, a door that closes and/or locks, and access to a sink and/or fridge \n2-3 tutorials rooms, capacity 30-40 each \n2 large presentation rooms, 1 of which must seat ~400 people \nSpace for an exhibit hall for ~12 sponsor tables \n(Possible) Open Space rooms - small meeting rooms \nRegistration area \n\n"},"budget/":{"url":"budget/","title":"Budget","keywords":"","body":"Budget and Finances\nTeam Size: 1.

Early bird tickets should be based on covering basic costs.\nStandard tickets should be more expensive than early bird tickets but priced to cover main conference expenses.\nHistorically, we have not set day-of or last-minute ticket prices. \nTicket tiers:\n\nReduced rate (Student, Diversity, and Unemployed)\nIndividual\nCorporate\nExpo Booth Only (by request; not listed on website)\n\nTicket levels:\n\nEarly Bird\nNormal pricing\n\nHow do I figure out how many tickets to sell?\nTake your total venue capacity and subtract out reserved tickets for volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and diversity tickets. This is the number of tickets you'll need.\nHow do I determine what our tickets should cost?\nWe use three basic pricing tiers with DjangoCon: reduced, individual, and corporate tiers. Our goal was to price our individual tickets just above our theoretical cost. \nIndividual: Take the break-even, per-attendee, before-taxes-and-ticket-fees cost and round it up to the nearest 95 (so if your break-even per-attendee cost is $435, round up to $495).\nReduced: Take the individual price and subtract $200-300; aim to keep below $300. These tickets are intended for students, unemployed or underemployed attendees, and people from underrepresented groups. We want to encourage these people to attend our event without pricing them out of the conference. \nCorporate: Take the individual price and add $200-300. These tickets to make up the difference in what we lose when we sell a reduced price ticket. As long as we sell more corporate tickets than reduced price tickets, we can afford to offer more reduced tickets.\nExpo Booth Only: Figure out the catering-only cost and price near that; usually this is priced more cheaply than the individual ticket, but more expensive than the reduced price ticket. \nWho gets a free ticket?\n\nSpeakers \nTutorial presenters \nSponsors (per their sponsorship agreement and sponsorship tier)\nCore organizers \n\n\"Core organizers\" means those organizers who are consistently involved in the planning of the conference in the 3-9 months leading up to the conference. Many organizers will be covered by speaker or tutorial presenter tickets or sponsor tickets, so practically this is usually less than 10 tickets. \nOnsite volunteers don't receive free conference tickets. This includes registration desk workers, session emcees and session runners, swag bag stuffers, sprint mentors, and other onsite volunteers. \nOverselling\nUnfortunately, not everyone who buys a ticket can actually attend. Business priorities change, job situation change, last minute deadlines, family emergencies, and people get busy. \nWe set 5% as an overselling goal. After polling half a dozen conference organizers about what percentage of attendees will not make it everyone came back with a number around 2% to 5% or 5% to 10%. This is an arbitrary and completely unscientific number so use it as a guide but adjust it to fit your situation.\nTutorials\nTutorials are currenty priced at $195/session. From 2015-2017, they were $150/session. We have 2 or 3 morning tutorials and 2 or 3 afternoon tutorials, for 4-6 tutorials total. The decision to host 4 or 6 tutorials can change year to year; in 2018, the conference sold almost entirely out of 6 tutorials. \nTutorial presenters receive $60/attendee and a complimentary conference ticket; the rest of the tutorial cost generally goes toward catering. Tutorials are not profitable (nor are they designed to be). \nThe attendance cap per tutorial depends on the room sizes in the venue; generally, the initial cap is 30 attendees, but we have been able to go as high as 35. \nHistorical Prices\n\n\n\nYear\nCorporate\nIndividual\nReduced-Price\nTutorial\nOther\n\n\n\n\n2018\n$695 / $795\n$495 / $595\n$295\n$195\nPatron: $995 Corporate Concierge: $995\n\n\n2017\n$545 / $645\n$345 / $445\n$245\n$150\n-\n\n\n2016\n$495 / $545\n$295 / $345\n$295\n$150\n-\n\n\n2015\n$695\n$495\n$250\n$150\n-\n\n\n2014\n$850\n$750\n$550\n$100\n-\n\n\n2013\n$995\n$895\n$525\n$125\n-\n\n\n2012\n$625\n$525\n$275\n$149\n-\n\n\n2011\n$595\n$495\n$250\n$125\n-\n\n\n2010\n$495\n$495\n$495\n-\n-\n\n\n\n"},"volunteers/conf_chair.html":{"url":"volunteers/conf_chair.html","title":"Conference Chair","keywords":"","body":"Conference Chair(s)\nTeam Size: 1-2\nResponsibilities: prior to conference\nGeneral\n\nGeneral manager of the conference, responsible for overall project management. \nKeep DEFNA in the loop for all major milestones and conference decisions \nIdentify high-level tasks that need to be performed, and ensure that volunteers are recruited to perform those tasks \nManage organizer debates and disagreements \nAuthorizations: Chair(s) should have admin or equivalent auth for the following services.

PyCon has 3,000 Python developers (which is great), but our experience is that most of the people who attend PyCon do not use Django. \n400 Django attendees can easily be more potential sales because you aren’t competing with as many booths/vendors, and everyone is here for the same reason. \nChecklists\n"},"sprints/":{"url":"sprints/","title":"Sprints","keywords":"","body":"Sprints\nTeam Size: 1\nResponsibilities\n\nRecruit a sprint venue, if not being provided by the conference venue \nEnsure the sprint venue has adequate wifi, power, etc. \nCoordinate sprint catering, if catering is not being provided by the regular conference venue contract \nBe the point of contact for open-source projects that wish to sprint  \nManage sprint announcements at the conference prior to sprints \nConfirm sprint rooms \nRecruit sprint volunteers to help onboard new sprinters \nAttend sprints and help when needed \n\nNotes\nIn 2018, we started an Intro to Sprinting workshop, designed to teach people the basics of open source software contribution including finding a ticket, using Git and GitHub, and opening a pull request. \nWe also started a Git Help Desk, a collection of volunteers to help sprinters with Git issues. \nChecklists\n"},"design/":{"url":"design/","title":"Swag & Graphics","keywords":"","body":"Swag & Graphics\nTeam Size: 1-2\nResponsibilities\n\nDevelop the visual brand for the conference together with the design team (outside hire) \nEnsure brand is uniformly applied across conference materials and online presence (website, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, other social media) \nEnsure the following swag items are ordered and delivered: \nStickers and/or buttons \nNecessary signage (banners and easel signs) \nConference badges\nLanyards\nSpeaker and organizer gifts\n\n\nManage t-shirts, if doing (sometimes this is included with the conference ticket, sometimes this is a Teespring or similar campaign after the conference) \nCoordinate with sponsors team to ensure sponsor logos are delivered \n\n"},"registration/visas.html":{"url":"registration/visas.html","title":"Visas","keywords":"","body":"Visas\nTeam Size: 1\nResponsibilities\n\nManage visas@djangocon.us email account\nUpdate visa invitation template \nIssue visa invitation letters when requested by potential attendees \nMake sure that visa and international travel information is posted on website in a timely manner \n\n"},"volunteers/":{"url":"volunteers/","title":"Volunteers","keywords":"","body":"Volunteers\nTeam Size: 1-2 \nResponsibilities\n\nCreate the volunteer sign-up spreadsheet to recruit: \nRegistration desk staff\nSession emcees \nSession runners \nSprint mentors \nSwag bag stuffers \n\n\nMake sure spreadsheet is added to website and communicated \nMake sure all volunteer slots get filled, including actively recruiting volunteers\nTrain volunteers on their roles through sharing written resources and/or onsite debriefing\nLead swag bag stuffing on tutorials day, or ensure that it is led \n\n"},"website/":{"url":"website/","title":"Website","keywords":"","body":"Website\nTeam Size: 1-2\nResponsibilities\n\nConsult with design team on yearly public-facing website design \nEnsure accessibility of website \nMake sure needed updates to the website (blog posts, schedule, etc.) happen\nManage pull requests and issues \nUpdate README to ensure contributors are able to be onboarded \n\n"},"templates/":{"url":"templates/","title":"Templates","keywords":"","body":"Templates\n"},"templates/conduct/":{"url":"templates/conduct/","title":"Code of Conduct","keywords":"","body":""},"templates/conduct/coc_about.html":{"url":"templates/conduct/coc_about.html","title":"About the CoC","keywords":"","body":"Subject: About the DjangoCon US Code of Conduct\nDear [name], \nWe are very proud to have a Code of Conduct for DjangoCon US [year] that covers the conference and any conference-related events.

For more information, see [link]. \nIf you plan to come, you may register at [link] as soon as possible. \nIf you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for us, please feel free to contact us. \nOn behalf of the DjangoCon US organizer's committee, I want to thank you again for your submission. You made our job picking talks very hard, and the conference will be better for it.\nI hope to see you in [city]!\nWarmly, \n[Your name] \n[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]\n"},"resources/":{"url":"resources/","title":"Resources","keywords":"","body":"Resources\nKnowing what belongs on a conference website is a challenge.
