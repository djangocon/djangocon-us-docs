# How to make bathroom baskets 

1. Order supplies from Amazon, or acquire locally 
  - [ ] small plastic baskets
  - [ ] Shout wipes
  - [ ] menstrual pads
  - [ ] tampons
  - [ ] individually-wrapped Claritin or other allergy tablets
  - [ ] individually-wrapped Advil or other painkiller tablets
  - [ ] bottles of Tums or other stomach medicine 
  - [ ] small bottles of lotion 
  - [ ] small bottles of hairspray
  - [ ] boxes of Band-Aids
  - [ ] small disposable toothbrushes (Wisps or similar) 
  - [ ] dental floss 
2. Print a sign (something that indicates, "Take what you need, leave some for others.") 
3. Assemble baskets (1 per bathroom). Put one of each item that can be resued (lotion, for example), and a generous handful of single-use items (medication) in each basket 
4. Place baskets on counters in all bathrooms. Be gender-inclusive and put all items in all baskets (some men menstruate, for example). 
5. Check on baskets at lunch and replenish if need be. 
6. Remove baskets at the end of the conference day, and replenish and replace the next morning.
