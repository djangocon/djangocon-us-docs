# Subject: DjangoCon US Code of Conduct Violation 

This template shouldn't be just copied and pasted. Every Code of Conduct incident is unique and should be handled sensitively and compassionately, and not with a form letter. This example exists to provide you with some useful wording in the unfortunate event that you need to respond to a Code of Conduct violation because coming up with the right words when you know someone has been hurt can be difficult. But again, please don't treat this example as a fill-in-the-blank form letter. Treat this example as a jumping-off point from which you can craft the right response to someone who has trusted you by reporting a Code of Conduct violation.
