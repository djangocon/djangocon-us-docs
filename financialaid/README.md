## Notes 

For the past several years, we've collected financial aid applications in a Google form. We then export the spreadsheet to [Grorg](http://grorg.aeracode.org/) for scoring. 

To use Grorg, contact Andrew Godwin (info [here](http://grorg.aeracode.org/)). Andrew will set up the new year's financial aid review system and give you a code. Log in or register with Grorg, then use the code to join this year's group. Upload the responses and get scoring. 

We do not use Grorg to allocate financial aid; we use a separate spreadsheet for that.
