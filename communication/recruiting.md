Dear [Person],

I'm familiar with your talk [talk] that you gave at [other conference], and I think it would be a great fit for DjangoCon. I'd like to invite you to submit that talk (or any other talk you think would be valuable to our community) to DjangoCon before our CFP closes on [date]. 

A little about DjangoCon: We are a small, nonprofit conference with about 400 attendees. We're looking for diverse topics that represent the experiences of our community, not just talks on the Django programming language. We have a Code of Conduct, a diversity statement, and an accessibility statement. Financial aid is available if cost is a concern. Our CFP closes on [date]: [link to CFP].  

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to see you speak at DjangoCon! 

Warmly, 

[Your name] 

[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
