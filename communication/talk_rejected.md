# DjangoCon US Proposal Decision
Dear [name],

Thank you very much for your DjangoCon US talk proposal. As you may know, we had record-breaking levels of talk submissions -- over [number]. Both the quantity and the quality of proposals were breathtaking. Sadly, we have just [number] spots on the schedule, so many excellent talks couldn't be accommodated. This was a gut-wrenching decision as there were many very good talks that were rejected simply because of a space limitation. 

Unfortunately, your talk [talk name] was not one of the ones selected to appear at DjangoCon US [year].

I do hope you'll choose to come to DjangoCon US regardless. It's an amazing conference. You may still want to consider delivering your material as a lightning talk (quick, five-minute talks on any topic). For more information, see [link]. 

If you plan to come, you should register at [link] as soon as possible. We have a limited number of tickets, and we expect to sell out. Please don't delay in picking up your tickets!

If you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for us, please feel free to contact me or the conference chair [name and email]. If you would like to receive feedback on your talk submission, please contact [name and email], who is happy to look through the review committee's notes and give you a summary.

On behalf of the DjangoCon US organizer's committee, I want to thank you again for your submission. You made our job picking talks very hard, and the conference will be better for it.

I hope to see you in [city]!

Warmly, 

[Your name] 
[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
