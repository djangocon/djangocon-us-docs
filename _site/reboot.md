# DjangoCon: Reboot

Today:

Before the flood of announcements begins, I wanted to let everyone know where the conference stands today. There have been a few changes since last year which have caused some delays and growing pains but I'm happy to say that we are back on track.

The most noticeable difference is that DjangoCon US is being ran by the newly formed Django Event Foundation North America (DEFNA) which is a pending non-profit dedicated to running Django related events in North America. Because we are a non-profit and not a commercial entity all money raised goes towards making DjangoCon US and future events better. Our goal is to make future DjangoCons affordable and to make our prices transparent. 

The DEFNA board is composed of three volunteers: Jeff Triplett (President), Craig Bruce (Treasurer), and Stacey Haysler (Secretary and DSF Treasurer).

## DjangoCon US 2015

Thanks to a small group of volunteers in Austin, TX who contacted over a dozen hotels and venues, I'm happy to say that we found a mix that we are comfortable with. When selecting a venues our goals included a number of factors such as: conference ticket price, food costs, hotel cost for our attendees, accessiblabilty, location, and potential financial risk with the contract. All of these factor things mattered. Specifically I'd like to thank Barbara Shaurette and Andrew Pinkham for organizing and leading this search along with Stephanie Gorosh for getting us the best venue. 

We are working on finalizing our budget so that we may announce ticket prices and beging conference registration. Our goal is to keep individual and student ticket prices below $500 which will be a significant change from previous years. Our Corporate rates will also be cheaper than previous years.

Going forward our goal is to push ticket prices down even further and we need more upfront planning for 2016 in order to accomplish this. This is also an important issue for the DSF whom we have been working with on a set of guidelines for future conferences. One of our goals is to use PyCon as a baseline for determining where ticket prices should be when we consider new venues.


I'd also like to thank the group at Lincoln Loop for designing and helping us launch the website. The Eldarion team were also instrumental and we'd like to thank them for hosting our current and past websites.

My involvement started last year when I volunteered to help out. I fixed website mistakes, updated copy on the website, and I helped review talks. I filled in for our Program Chair with less than a weeks notice and my goal was to fill in the program gaps and make the conference run without a hitch. I feel pretty good about that.

The DSF asked a Craig Bruce, Stacey Haysler, and myself.

The Django Event Foundation North America (DEFNA) is a pending non-profit 501(c)(3) which was created in the spirit of organizing DjangoCon US and expanding to help organize other Django related events and conferences. The DSF granted DEFNA a license run the official DjangoCon US conference.

As of February 18th, 2015 DEFNA obtained it's pending 

In February, DEFNA was approved by the State of California as a pending non-profit 501(c)(3) status. Our first measure of order was forming our board and looking through our list of proposals.

DEFNA had our first board meeting to elect officers to our board: Me (President), Stacey Haysler (Secretary / DSF Treasurer), and Craig Bruce (Treasurer).
