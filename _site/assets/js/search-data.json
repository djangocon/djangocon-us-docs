Some years it’s seamless, other years projectors may flicker or there may be mic static that needs to be dealt with. It’s helpful to have a single person dedicated to responding to reports of A/V issues at the conference and who can communicate with the onsite A/V and recording teams to debug issues.It’s helpful for the A/V person to also have a stash of dongles so that all presenters are able to plug their laptops into presentation hardware even if they don’t have their own adapters.Checklist  Determine which company will be doing the A/V  Who’s creating video splash screen?  Video Editing?  Closed captioning of video?

Other to-do items will come up in the planning process; every year is different. All organizers are free to help other areas as needed; organizers are not territorial about their areas.The Django Software Foundation has published guidelines for hosting an event that is branded “DjangoCon.”The guidelines in this GitBook are specific to DjangoCon US, which is a two-track conference that takes place over six days in North America.Some unpublished rules about hosting a DjangoCon will vary depending on the location of the DjangoCon; for example, in the United States, we are required to host our event a specific amount of time away from PyCon US and DjangoCon Europe.

We recruit reviewers from the community and add them to Papercall as “reviewers” to let them review  We do not discount talks for being “not Pythonic/Djangonic” enough  Tutorial presenters and speakers get complimentary conference passesNotesWhen selecting the program, look for these things:  We don’t give people more than one speaking slot. If someone is presenting a tutorial, they may still give a talk, but we prioritize other proposers.  If you have two highly-rated submissions from the same speaker and that speaker is from an underrepresented group, accept the more technical talk  Make sure the speakers from underrepresented groups aren’t solely giving “soft” talks  Talks on trendy topics tend to be highly rated. Don’t accept multiple talks on the same or very similar topics; make sure to select a program that covers a wide range of topics  It’s fine to select organizers as speakers, but be wary of the program being too heavy on organizers.  We don’t accept panels where the moderator or panelists haven’t been selected. We are generally wary of panels, but we have accepted them before.  We will not present an all-white or all-male panel.Resources  Tutorial FAQ EmailCall for Proposals Examples  http://2014.djangocon.us/lightning_talks_open_spaces/  http://2015.djangocon.eu/proposals/  http://2015.pycon-au.org/cfp  https://github.com/nodeconf/US-CFP  https://us.pycon.org/2015/speaking/cfp/Checklists",

Our plans are significantly cheaper across the board, but PyCon’s discounts for small businesses does help with budgets.The flip side is, PyCon only has booths open for two days (plus a few hours the night before). They also accept many more sponsors, so booth placement is a larger issue. Some companies who sponsor at lower levels won’t get the booth placement that a company sponsoring at a higher level gets.Our main advantage is that we have 400-500 Django developers, designers, managers, and decision makers who attend DjangoCon US including lots of startups who are looking for good tools. PyCon has 3,000 Python developers (which is great), but our experience is that most of the people who attend PyCon do not use Django.400 Django attendees can easily be more potential sales because you aren’t competing with as many booths/vendors, and everyone is here for the same reason.",

    "content": "TicketsGet tickets on sale sooner rather than later.Reserve 10%-20% of ticket allocation for organizers, speakers, and sponsors.Early bird tickets should provide an incentive for attendees to be buy sooner than later. Early bird tickets should be based on covering basic costs.Standard tickets should be more expensive than early bird tickets but priced to cover main conference expenses.Historically, we have not set day-of or last-minute ticket prices.Ticket tiers:  Reduced rate (Student, Diversity, and Unemployed)  Individual  Corporate  Expo Booth Only (by request; not listed on website)Ticket levels:  Early Bird  Normal pricingHow do I figure out how many tickets to sell?Take your total venue capacity and subtract out reserved tickets for volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and diversity tickets. This is the number of tickets you’ll need.How do I determine what our tickets should cost?We use three basic pricing tiers with DjangoCon: reduced, individual, and corporate tiers. Our goal was to price our individual tickets just above our theoretical cost.Individual: Take the break-even, per-attendee, before-taxes-and-ticket-fees cost and round it up to the nearest 95 (so if your break-even per-attendee cost is $435, round up to $495).Reduced: Take the individual price and subtract $200-300; aim to keep below $300. These tickets are intended for students, unemployed or underemployed attendees, and people from underrepresented groups. We want to encourage these people to attend our event without pricing them out of the conference.Corporate: Take the individual price and add $200-300. These tickets to make up the difference in what we lose when we sell a reduced price ticket. As long as we sell more corporate tickets than reduced price tickets, we can afford to offer more reduced tickets.Expo Booth Only: Figure out the catering-only cost and price near that; usually this is priced more cheaply than the individual ticket, but more expensive than the reduced price ticket.Who gets a free ticket?  Speakers  Tutorial presenters  Sponsors (per their sponsorship agreement and sponsorship tier)  Core organizers“Core organizers” means those organizers who are consistently involved in the planning of the conference in the 3-9 months leading up to the conference. Many organizers will be covered by speaker or tutorial presenter tickets or sponsor tickets, so practically this is usually less than 10 tickets.Onsite volunteers don’t receive free conference tickets. This includes registration desk workers, session emcees and session runners, swag bag stuffers, sprint mentors, and other onsite volunteers.OversellingUnfortunately, not everyone who buys a ticket can actually attend. Business priorities change, job situation change, last minute deadlines, family emergencies, and people get busy.We set 5% as an overselling goal. After polling half a dozen conference organizers about what percentage of attendees will not make it everyone came back with a number around 2% to 5% or 5% to 10%. This is an arbitrary and completely unscientific number so use it as a guide but adjust it to fit your situation.TutorialsTutorials are currenty priced at $195/session. From 2015-2017, they were $150/session. We have 2 or 3 morning tutorials and 2 or 3 afternoon tutorials, for 4-6 tutorials total. The decision to host 4 or 6 tutorials can change year to year; in 2018, the conference sold almost entirely out of 6 tutorials.Tutorial presenters receive $60/attendee and a complimentary conference ticket; the rest of the tutorial cost generally goes toward catering. Tutorials are not profitable (nor are they designed to be).The attendance cap per tutorial depends on the room sizes in the venue; generally, the initial cap is 30 attendees, but we have been able to go as high as 35.Historical Prices            Year      Corporate      Individual      Reduced-Price      Tutorial      Other                  2018      $695 / $795      $495 / $595      $295      $195      Patron: $995 Corporate Concierge: $995              2017      $545 / $645      $345 / $445      $245      $150      -              2016      $495 / $545      $295 / $345      $295      $150      -              2015      $695      $495      $250      $150      -              2014      $850      $750      $550      $100      -              2013      $995      $895      $525      $125      -              2012      $625      $525      $275      $149      -              2011      $595      $495      $250      $125      -              2010      $495      $495      $495      -      -      ",

A few of you have asked about tutorial fees and I thought it’d be best to discuss it with everyone. I built a FAQ-like format to get the ball rolling. Please ask me anything.How much are tutorials?Tutorials are ${{tutorial_price}} a person and we pay you {{tutorial_speaker_percent}} of that.What does the ${{tutorial_price}} cover?This covers access to your room, lunch, and snacks for the day for you and your students.Why did we pick {{tutorial_speaker_percent}}?Our venue charges us ${{tutorial_venue_cost_per_day}} + tax per person and we know you are spending a lot of time to prepare for this. {{tutorial_speaker_percent}} is close enough. The conference does not want to make money on tutorial day, we just want to cover our basic costs or come close.Am I required to buy my own day pass?No. That would be really crummy to ask you to pay to give a tutorial. The day is on us.May I donate the money to the DSF, DjangoGirls, etc.The money is yours to do whatever you want with. Attending DjangoCon US is not free and we are sensitive to the fact that many of you are self employed and paying your own way into the conference.Are tutorials recorded?No, based on your feedback. It’s also price prohibitive without charging each attendee significantly more.Will tutorials be free next year?We are learning a lot this year and venue management is high on our list. Next year we are already planning on adopting an open day format with both free and paid tutorials. We have two city proposals which are game changers compared to following the model that exists today.What is our classroom size?We originally were capped at 25 attendees per room but we upgraded rooms. In theory you could have up to 50 students per room but we capped ticket sales to 30. If you want us to increase the cap on your sales please email me and I’ll adjust it.How many attendees have signed up for my tutorial?These range from 7 to 25, but we still have two+ weeks left to market them. Email me for an exact number.Can we promote our own tutorials?Not only can you promote your own tutorials, we would really appreciate if you would promote your tutorial via Twitter and social media :)",

    "content": "Audience: Session chairs, session runners, registration staffHey there, volunteers!Thank you so much for volunteering with DjangoCon US! We truly couldn’t do this without your help, and we appreciate your time. Here are some things that might make your volunteer experience easier:  The volunteer handbook is online. This includes contact information for the conference staff, important phone numbers, a schedule of events, locations of important rooms, and some tips for sessions chairs and session runners.  Review the volunteer shifts you signed up for, and set yourself a reminder so you don’t lose track of time. (It’s easy to do at a conference where so many awesome things are going on!)  If you witness a Code of Conduct violation, or someone reports one to you, please call conference staff as soon as possible; let the person who reported the violation know you have done so; offer to stay with them until we arrive; offer to help them with contacting a friend, hotel security, law enforcement, or anyone else; and do not make any public statements about the event. Respect their privacy.A couple of things just for session chairs:  Be sure you know how to pronounce your speaker’s name.  Ask your speaker if they want to take questions at the end of their talk.  Confirm how speaker would like time kept: signs, hand signals, and when you should start counting down.  Before you start taking questions, remind the audience to ask appropriate questions. “Before we take questions, please remember to keep your questions short, on-topic, respectful, and formed as questions.”  If someone asks a question that is not a question, say, “I’m sorry to interrupt, but we are looking for questions only. Please save comments and feedback for later.” There are more tips for dealing with unhelpful questions in the handbook.  If a presenter says something, or has a slide in their talk, that violates the Code of Conduct, contact the conference staff as soon as you can. If it’s not that big of a deal, let us know, but don’t stop the talk. If their talk is completely outside the realm of acceptable behavior, interrupt the speaker, discontinue the talk, and contact conference staff immediately. If you are not sure, step out of the talk, call conference staff, and ask us to come review the talk ASAP. [NUMBER] will reach a DEFNA board member at all times.  An example of a minor violation that does not warrant stopping the talk: A single slide that makes an inappropriate joke at the expense of a marginalized group. You should contact conference staff after the session so we can review with the speaker, but there is no need to stop the talk.  An example of a major violation that warrants stopping the talk: Most slides use sexual or racist imagery; and/or the speaker continually and repeatedly makes derogatory remarks or jokes at the expense of a marginalized group. “I’m sorry, but we won’t be able to continue this talk at this time” is a useful script in this situation.We hope your volunteer experience is fun and memorable! If you have any questions, conference staff will have organizer ribbons on our badges so you can flag us down easily. You can also respond to this email.DjangoCon US Team",

    "content": "Good morning everyone and welcome to DjangoCon US!My name is Jeff Triplett and I am a developer and consultant at Revolution Systems in Lawrence, KS. I’m a co-founder of the Django Events Foundation of North America or DEFNA for short. It is my esteemed honor to be your conference chair for 2016.Now that you know a little bit about me. I want to find out a little bit about you. If you are in our spill over room, my apologies for not being able to see you.How many of you are from Philly?What about outside of the United States?What about your first DjangoCon ever?What about your first DjangoCon US ever?At least two DjangoCons?Five?Ten?This is 9th annual North American gathering of Django developers, designers, writers, teachers, mentors, organizers, volunteers, enthusiasts, and hobbyists just to name a few. Last week the Django project also turned 11 years old so happy birthday to the Django project.I’m proud to say that for the second year in a row, DjangoCon US is organized by the community for the community.All of our organizers have volunteered their time and energy.DEFNA along with a dozen community organizers, over three dozen community volunteers, and over fifty speakers have all contributed to make DjangoCon US a success.All money raised from DjangoCon goes back into supporting future conferences, events, financial aid, and we donate to support the DSF.DjangoCon US brings people from around the world together for six days to interact and learn from one another.The format is: one day of tutorials, three days of talks, followed by two days of code sprints where people work on Django or Django related projects.This year we added an orientation event, open spaces, we are sponsoring/hosting a Django Girls Workshop, and our Philly Postgres friends asked if they could host a PG Day. It’s been a great year.The one thing that we all have in common is the Django web framework.This year we promoted two fundamental changes.We added a double blind review process so that talk proposals were picked base on their content. Reviewers could not tell who the speakers nor who the other reviewers were. It wasn’t foolproof, but it did result a schedule which features over 40% women speakers. This is up about 10% over last year.We also discouraged the usage of phrases like “not Pythonic” and “not Django enough” because we felt like those phrases put too much emphasis on the framework aspects of Django while de-emphasizing the web aspects of Django. After all, Django is “web framework” and not just about Python. You can have both.These subtle yet important changes opened the door for a much more diverse program without sacrificing any of the technical content. Diversity does not mean sacrificing value.We could not have accomplished this without both community and sponsor support.Let’s be honest, we love our sponsors. Their contributions have helped us decrease tickets prices by 50% in just two years. Please thank them and talk to them when you see someone wearing a RED sponsors badge. Some even have cool things to give you including stickers, t-shirts, swag, and jobs.The University of Pennsylvania: Wharton Computing was kind enough to sponsor and provide us an amazing space, classrooms, their staff, and even add a few new friendly faces to our organizer team. Special thanks to Heather “HEATS” Luna and Tim Allen.I also want to give a quick thank you to Lincoln Loop for their support. Not only did they sponsor the conference, but they also designed our website and handled our swag. Thank you for making DjangoCon pretty, Mark, Peter, and Jessie.I also want to thank Eldarion and Eldarion Cloud for hosting our website and for the Symposion project which powers our website.Finally, several of our sponsors have booths setup in the MBA Lounge and Cafe.

    "content": "Good morning everyone and welcome to DjangoCon US!My name is Jeff Triplett and I am a developer and consultant at Revolution Systems in Lawrence, KS. I’m a co-founder of the Django Events Foundation of North America or DEFNA for short. It is my esteemed honor to be your conference chair for 2016.Now that you know a little bit about me. I want to find out a little bit about you. If you are in our spill over room, my apologies for not being able to see you.How many of you are from Philly?What about outside of the United States?What about your first DjangoCon ever?What about your first DjangoCon US ever?At least two DjangoCons?Five?Ten?This is 9th annual North American gathering of Django developers, designers, writers, teachers, mentors, organizers, volunteers, enthusiasts, and hobbyists just to name a few. Last week the Django project also turned 11 years old so happy birthday to the Django project.I’m proud to say that for the second year in a row, DjangoCon US is organized by the community for the community.All of our organizers have volunteered their time and energy.DEFNA along with a dozen community organizers, over three dozen community volunteers, and over fifty speakers have all contributed to make DjangoCon US a success.All money raised from DjangoCon goes back into supporting future conferences, events, financial aid, and we donate to support the DSF.DjangoCon US brings people from around the world together for six days to interact and learn from one another.The format is: one day of tutorials, three days of talks, followed by two days of code sprints where people work on Django or Django related projects.This year we added an orientation event, open spaces, we are sponsoring/hosting a Django Girls Workshop, and our Philly Postgres friends asked if they could host a PG Day. It’s been a great year.The one thing that we all have in common is the Django web framework.This year we promoted two fundamental changes in our talk and tutorial selection process.We added a double blind review process so that talk proposals were picked base on their content. Reviewers could not tell who the speakers nor who the other reviewers were. It wasn’t foolproof, but it did result a schedule which features over 40% women speakers. This increased from 30% last year.We also discouraged the usage of phrases like “not Pythonic” and “not Django enough” because we felt like those phrases put too much emphasis on the framework aspects of Django while de-emphasizing the web aspects of Django.

    "content": "DjangoCon: RebootToday:Before the flood of announcements begins, I wanted to let everyone know where the conference stands today. There have been a few changes since last year which have caused some delays and growing pains but I’m happy to say that we are back on track.The most noticeable difference is that DjangoCon US is being ran by the newly formed Django Event Foundation North America (DEFNA) which is a pending non-profit dedicated to running Django related events in North America. Because we are a non-profit and not a commercial entity all money raised goes towards making DjangoCon US and future events better. Our goal is to make future DjangoCons affordable and to make our prices transparent.The DEFNA board is composed of three volunteers: Jeff Triplett (President), Craig Bruce (Treasurer), and Stacey Haysler (Secretary and DSF Treasurer).DjangoCon US 2015Thanks to a small group of volunteers in Austin, TX who contacted over a dozen hotels and venues, I’m happy to say that we found a mix that we are comfortable with. When selecting a venues our goals included a number of factors such as: conference ticket price, food costs, hotel cost for our attendees, accessiblabilty, location, and potential financial risk with the contract. All of these factor things mattered. Specifically I’d like to thank Barbara Shaurette and Andrew Pinkham for organizing and leading this search along with Stephanie Gorosh for getting us the best venue.We are working on finalizing our budget so that we may announce ticket prices and beging conference registration. Our goal is to keep individual and student ticket prices below $500 which will be a significant change from previous years. Our Corporate rates will also be cheaper than previous years.Going forward our goal is to push ticket prices down even further and we need more upfront planning for 2016 in order to accomplish this. This is also an important issue for the DSF whom we have been working with on a set of guidelines for future conferences. One of our goals is to use PyCon as a baseline for determining where ticket prices should be when we consider new venues.I’d also like to thank the group at Lincoln Loop for designing and helping us launch the website. The Eldarion team were also instrumental and we’d like to thank them for hosting our current and past websites.My involvement started last year when I volunteered to help out. I fixed website mistakes, updated copy on the website, and I helped review talks. I filled in for our Program Chair with less than a weeks notice and my goal was to fill in the program gaps and make the conference run without a hitch. I feel pretty good about that.The DSF asked a Craig Bruce, Stacey Haysler, and myself.The Django Event Foundation North America (DEFNA) is a pending non-profit 501(c)(3) which was created in the spirit of organizing DjangoCon US and expanding to help organize other Django related events and conferences. The DSF granted DEFNA a license run the official DjangoCon US conference.As of February 18th, 2015 DEFNA obtained it’s pendingIn February, DEFNA was approved by the State of California as a pending non-profit 501(c)(3) status. Our first measure of order was forming our board and looking through our list of proposals.DEFNA had our first board meeting to elect officers to our board: Me (President), Stacey Haysler (Secretary / DSF Treasurer), and Craig Bruce (Treasurer).",
