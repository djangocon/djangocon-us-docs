Hello everyone,

DjangoCon US is {{tutorial_start_date|weeks}} weeks away and I wanted to go over a few things with everyone. My apologies for the delay.

A few of you have asked about tutorial fees and I thought it'd be best to discuss it with everyone. I built a FAQ-like format to get the ball rolling. Please ask me anything.

## How much are tutorials?

Tutorials are ${{tutorial_price}} a person and we pay *you* {{tutorial_speaker_percent}} of that. 

## What does the ${{tutorial_price}} cover?

This covers access to your room, lunch, and snacks for the day for you and your students.

## Why did we pick {{tutorial_speaker_percent}}?

Our venue charges us ${{tutorial_venue_cost_per_day}} + tax *per person* and we know you are spending a lot of time to prepare for this. {{tutorial_speaker_percent}} is close enough. The conference does not want to make money on tutorial day, we just want to cover our basic costs or come close.

## Am I required to buy my own day pass?

No. That would be really crummy to ask you to pay to give a tutorial. The day is on us.

## May I donate the money to the DSF, DjangoGirls, etc.

The money is yours to do whatever you want with. Attending DjangoCon US is not free and we are sensitive to the fact that many of you are self employed and paying your own way into the conference.

## Are tutorials recorded?

No, based on your feedback. It's also price prohibitive without charging each attendee significantly more.

## Will tutorials be free next year?

We are learning a lot this year and venue management is high on our list. Next year we are already planning on adopting an open day format with both free and paid tutorials. We have two city proposals which are game changers compared to following the model that exists today.

## What is our classroom size?

We originally were capped at 25 attendees per room but we upgraded rooms. In theory you could have up to 50 students per room but we capped ticket sales to 30. If you want us to increase the cap on your sales please email me and I'll adjust it.

## How many attendees have signed up for my tutorial?

These range from 7 to 25, but we still have two+ weeks left to market them. Email me for an exact number. 

## Can we promote our own tutorials?

Not only can you promote your own tutorials, we would really appreciate if you would promote your tutorial via Twitter and social media :)
