We had an amazing organizer team this year. We had most of our team back from last year along with adding a few new members.

It took a lot of caring, heart, and soul to put on the program that you have just seen and you should all be very proud of the efforts that you put in. Thank you!

Please come up as I call your names.




If you are interested in the sprints Landon is going to give an overview right after the closing.

BUT first, we want to take a group photo with everyone.
