## Call for Proposals

### We want proposals from...

#### You.

This is a community conference. You're coming to the event, and that makes you part of the community. If you've done something that you think other people might be interested in, or that you think they should know about, please do consider telling us about it.

We don't just want to hear from the experts or famous names - other perspectives are just as valuable, so don't let the idea that you're not expert or famous enough stop you because it won't stop us from selecting your talk or the audience from enjoying it.

### We especially want proposals from...

#### People who are minorities in this field

The most visible faces in open source software development are white and male. Diversity is important to us. If you can help us make this event more diverse just by being there, please, do come forward with a proposal. We need you.

#### First-time speakers

If you haven't spoken at a conference before, this is your invitation to do so. After all, we want to be remembered as the conference where you started your superstar speaking career. You'll find that a Python/Django audience is friendly and receptive, so don't be shy.

If you'd like any help in proposing, preparing or presenting your talk, whoever you are and whatever kind of help you'd find useful: please see our speaker mentor programme .

## PROPOSE A...

### Tutorial

Can you lead a tutorial, on a Python or Django topic?

We'll be holding introductory workshops on our opening day, and more advanced sessions alongside the sprints on Thursday and Friday.

Please don't hesitate to suggest a workshop for the event, using the workshop proposal form. We're open to all kinds of ideas, and especially ones we haven't even thought of.

If you are interested in sample proposals, here is an example of what has been accepted over the last few years:

Proposals on any subject are welcomed, at any level of technical expertise.

Tell us about your experiments, discoveries, solutions, achievements and other adventures, using the talk proposal form.

#### Talk Format

The preferred length for talks is 20-25 minutes or 40-45 minute extended slots, but proposals requiring 45 minutes will be reviewed more stringently.

Session lengths include time for audience questions. You should budget at least five minutes for questions; for example, a 25-minute talk will be 20 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of questions. Please note that audience questions are optional and completely up to the speaker's preference.

#### Presentation Recording

Every session at DjangoCon US will have professionally-produced video recordings for release to either Confreaks and/or our YouTube channel.

If you do not wish to have your talk recorded the please note this in your submission. Doing so will not influence the selection process in any way.

### Lightning talks

We're planning on at least two days of lightning talks with opportunities for five-minute talk slots. We will take application upfront for the first day. However, you don't need to register in advance; just put your name down on the day. Anything goes!

## HOW TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL

There's a proposal form for talks and a proposal form for tutorials and demonstrations. Take a look at them - they'll make it clearer how this works.

Don't agonize over your proposal. Just get it in. We'll get back to you if anything's not clear.

Don't hesitate to submit more than one proposal either.

The deadline for submissions is the end of **May 8th**. We'll let you know if your talk is accepted by **May 25th**.

## HOW WE'LL CHOOSE

We're going to choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add up to the most enjoyable and interesting program for our attendees.

We won't just be choosing the ones from the most expert speakers, or even the most exciting subjects, because we need to have a good balance as well.

We'll publish the list of selected talks as soon as we can after the deadline.

## FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SPEAKERS

Grants to assist speakers on low budgets will be awarded by a committee of the Django Software Foundation. A number of free and discounted tickets will also be made available, and allocated by the committee. A call for applications to the grants committee will be made soon.

The grants committee will be especially interested in receiving applications from people belonging to under-represented demographic groups.
