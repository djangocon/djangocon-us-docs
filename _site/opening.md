Good morning everyone and welcome to DjangoCon US!

My name is Jeff Triplett and I am a developer and consultant at Revolution Systems in Lawrence, KS. I'm a co-founder of the Django Events Foundation of North America or DEFNA for short. It is my esteemed honor to be your conference chair for 2016. 

Now that you know a little bit about me. I want to find out a little bit about you. If you are in our spill over room, my apologies for not being able to see you.

How many of you are from Philly?

What about outside of the United States?

What about your first DjangoCon ever?

What about your first DjangoCon US ever?

At least two DjangoCons?

Five?

Ten?

This is 9th annual North American gathering of Django developers, designers, writers, teachers, mentors, organizers, volunteers, enthusiasts, and hobbyists just to name a few. Last week the Django project also turned 11 years old so happy birthday to the Django project.

I'm proud to say that for the second year in a row, DjangoCon US is organized by the community for the community. 

All of our organizers have volunteered their time and energy.

DEFNA along with a dozen community organizers, over three dozen community volunteers, and over fifty speakers have all contributed to make DjangoCon US a success. 

All money raised from DjangoCon goes back into supporting future conferences, events, financial aid, and we donate to support the DSF.

DjangoCon US brings people from around the world together for six days to interact and learn from one another. 

The format is: one day of tutorials, three days of talks, followed by two days of code sprints where people work on Django or Django related projects. 

This year we added an orientation event, open spaces, we are sponsoring/hosting a Django Girls Workshop, and our Philly Postgres friends asked if they could host a PG Day. It's been a great year.

The one thing that we all have in common is the Django *web* framework. 

This year we promoted two fundamental changes in our talk and tutorial selection process.

We added a double blind review process so that talk proposals were picked base on their content. Reviewers could not tell who the speakers nor who the other reviewers were. It wasn't foolproof, but it did result a schedule which features over 40% women speakers. This increased from 30% last year. 

We also discouraged the usage of phrases like "not Pythonic" and "not Django enough" because we felt like those phrases put too much emphasis on the framework aspects of Django while de-emphasizing the *web* aspects of Django. After all, Django is "web framework" and not just about Python. You can have both.

These subtle yet important changes opened the door for a much more diverse program without sacrificing any of the technical content. Diversity does not mean sacrificing value. 

We could not have accomplished this without both community and sponsor support.

Let's be honest, we love our sponsors. Their contributions have helped us decrease tickets prices by 50% in just two years. Please thank them and talk to them when you see someone wearing a **RED** sponsors badge. Some even have cool things to give you including stickers, t-shirts, swag, and jobs.


The University of Pennsylvania: Wharton Computing was kind enough to sponsor and provide us an amazing space, classrooms, their staff, and even add a few new friendly faces to our organizer team. Special thanks to Heather "HEATS" Luna and Tim Allen.


I also want to give a quick thank you to Lincoln Loop for their support. Not only did they sponsor the conference, but they also designed our website and handled our swag. Thank you for making DjangoCon pretty, Mark, Peter, and Jessie.


I also want to thank Eldarion and Eldarion Cloud for hosting our website and for the Symposion project which powers our website.


Finally, several of our sponsors have booths setup in the MBA Lounge and Cafe. Please stop by and thank them when you see them. Postgres Experts, Caktus Group, Linode, Sentry, and Revolution Systems (where I work).

Now to my favorite part of the opening, I want to introduce our conference co-chair Lacey Williams Henschel who has done a wonderful job this. Please welcome the amazing Lacey.
