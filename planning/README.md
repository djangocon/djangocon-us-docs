# DjangoCon Guidelines 

## About organizing DjangoCon US 

Some areas of responsibility come into play very early in the planning process. A website lead is needed very early on, for example. Other areas of responsibility only come into play at the conference itself, such as the registration coordinator. The conference chair(s) are selected very early in the process.  

The list of responsibilities for each area is meant to be comprehensive, but not necessarily exhaustive. Other to-do items will come up in the planning process; every year is different. All organizers are free to help other areas as needed; organizers are not territorial about their areas. 

The Django Software Foundation has published [guidelines](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/conferences/) for hosting an event that is branded "DjangoCon."

The guidelines in this GitBook are specific to DjangoCon US, which is a two-track conference that takes place over six days in North America. 

Some unpublished rules about hosting a DjangoCon will vary depending on the location of the DjangoCon; for example, in the United States, we are required to host our event a specific amount of time away from PyCon US and DjangoCon Europe. If you would like to host a DjangoCon or another Django event, please contact the DSF for more information.

## Conference Schedule 

The Code of Conduct covers all conference events, including those hosted by sponsors 

### Conference Days (All Days)

Continental breakfast and lunch offered. Snacks are optional, but desirable.

### Tutorials (1 Day)

- 2-3 rooms, setup classroom style (2-3 tutorials in the morning, and 2-3 in the afternoon)
- Each with projector, microphone, and power strips for attendees to plug into 
- Depending on number of rooms available, 75-200 people expected

### Talks (3 Days)

- Expected attendance: 450-500
- Morning starts with a keynote in one large room (if possible, book a spillover room with streaming of the keynote)
- For rest of day, two rooms setup theater or classroom style are desirable, to provide two presentation tracks. (If venue cannot provide two rooms, one track is an acceptable alternative.)
- Projector and at least one microphone needed per room. 
- If a panel is scheduled, make more chairs and more microphones available. 
- Provide power cords and extra dongles for various laptop-to-video outputs for presenters.
- Provide power strips in audience for attendees. 

### Sprint Days (2 Days)

- Expected attendance: 150 - 200.
- Can book sprint venue at the same venue as the rest of the conference, but this will be the most expensive option for catering
- Can book sprint venue at an alternate venue (possibly a local tech company or coworking space will donate their space). This can be less expensive for catering, but may require attendees to travel from the hotel.

### Optional Events 

#### Newcomer Orientation

- Cost: free 
- Schedule the evening after tutorials, or the first day of talks before the keynote 
- Presentation that lasts about 30-60 minutes and covers: 
  - Code of Conduct 
  - Impostor syndrome 
  - Self care, using the quiet room, trying to exercise the extrovert muscle 

#### Welcome Reception

- Cost: Free if sponsored, $5,000-10,000 if not 
- Schedule on the evening of the first talks day 
- Can be sponsored by one or more sponsors, or can be hosted by the main conference. 
- Add the event to the schedule and promote it 
- We require that the event not provide free alcohol, but it can be held in a place where people can purchase their own alcoholic beveraes 
- We ask that light appetizers be served 
- We ask that the event be held in a place where consumption of alcohol isn't the main activity (bowling alley, arcade, mini golf, etc.)
- Expected attendance: about 70% of the attendees

#### Speaker Dinner 

- Cost: Free if sponsored; varies depending on event type otherwise 
- Schedule on the evening of the tutorials day, or the second or third talks day (to not conflict with opening reception)
- Same rules as welcome reception with regard to venue, alcohol
- Invite tutorial presenters, keynote speakers, speakers, panelists and panel moderators, organizers
- Expected attendance: 85-90% of the invitees

#### Board Game Night 

- Cost: usually free, or the cost of an extra meeting room for a few hours 
- Book an extra room at the venue on the second or third evening of the conference from when the last talk ends to 9:00 or 10:00 pm 
- Add to conference schedule and publicize 
- People bring their own board games; this is a self-managing event for the most part. 

#### Django Girls Workshop 

- Cost: Free for the conference, unless we choose to sponsor 
- Expected attendance: 40-50 attendees, 10-15 coaches 
- Is organized by a local team with separate sponsorship and separate budgets from the main conference, but coordinates with the main conference so we can help if possible. 
- May be able to use same venue as the conference or piggyback on our food order; this is very budget-dependent. 
- May use an entirely different venue and catering, but cross-promote with our conference 
- Explore offering deeply discounted or free conference tickets to workshop attendees; historically, only a small percentage of workshop attendees wish to attend the full conference, so this is generally not a large cost 

#### Other Sponsor Events 

- Cost: Free for the conference
- At sponsor discretion 
- May include an evening event that they ask us to promote but we are not involved in (2018 Mini-Golf with Caktus), or a hosted lunch (2018's Women and Non-Binary Luncheon hosted by Microsoft Azuere Advocates) at the venue that we help them coordinate with venue staff but they fund.
