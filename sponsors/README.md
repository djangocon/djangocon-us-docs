## What is the difference between DjangoCon US and PyCon US?

It’s really hard to compare PyCon with DjangoCon. Our plans are significantly cheaper across the board, but PyCon's discounts for small businesses does help with budgets. 

The flip side is, PyCon only has booths open for two days (plus a few hours the night before). They also accept many more sponsors, so booth placement is a larger issue. Some companies who sponsors at lower levels won't get the booth placement that a company sponsoring at a higher level gets. 

Our main advantage is that we have around 400 Django developers, designers, managers, and decision makers who attend DjangoCon including lots of startups who are looking for good tools. PyCon has 3,000 Python developers (which is great), but our experience is that most of the people who attend PyCon do not use Django. We'd be surprised if more than 10% of PyCon attendees use Django. 

So this really depends on the type of product that a company has. 400 Django attendees can easily be more potential sales because you aren’t competing with as many booths/vendors, and everyone is here for the same reason, which isn’t quite the case with PyCon.
