## Notes

In 2018, we started an Intro to Sprinting workshop, designed to teach people the basics of open source software contribution including finding a ticket, using Git and GitHub, and opening a pull request.

We also started a Git Help Desk, a collection of volunteers to help sprinters with Git issues.
