# Registration 

Team Size: 1-2

## Responsibilities 

- Coordinate management of registration desk during the conference, including: 
    - Distributing badges 
    - Answering questions (aka being an Information Desk) 
- Ensure registration desk is staffed at all times as defined in volunteer signup spreadsheet 
- Ensuring registration desk is supplied with standard office supplies 

## Notes 

People will line up to check in about 15-30 minutes prior to the posted "open" time on the first talks day. 

The tutorials day acts as a "dry run" for the first conference day.

The first day of talks is the busiest day for registration.
