Print a sign (something that indicates, "Take what you need, leave some for others.")

Assemble baskets (1 per bathroom). Put one of each item that can be resued (lotion, for example), and a generous handful of single-use items (medication) in each basket

Place baskets on counters in all bathrooms. Be gender-inclusive and put all items in all baskets (some men menstruate, for example).

Check on baskets after each break and replenish if need be.

Remove baskets at the end of the conference day, and replenish and replace the next morning.

- Tylenol is an ideal painkiller because most pregnant people are able to take it, and they generally should avoid other painkillers. However, if you can have both Tylenol and an NSAID like Advil, that is best as different people respond differently to different medications.
