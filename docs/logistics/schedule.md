# Schedule

The Code of Conduct covers all conference events, including those hosted by sponsors 

## Conference Days (All Days)

Continental breakfast and lunch offered. Snacks are optional, but desirable.

## Tutorials (1 Day)

- 2-3 rooms, setup classroom style (2-3 tutorials in the morning, and 2-3 in the afternoon)
- Each with projector, microphone, and power strips for attendees to plug into 
- Depending on number of rooms available, 75-200 people expected

## Talks (3 Days)

- Expected attendance: 450-500
- Morning starts with a keynote in one large room (if possible, book a spillover room with streaming of the keynote)
- For rest of day, two rooms setup theater or classroom style are desirable, to provide two presentation tracks. (If venue cannot provide two rooms, one track is an acceptable alternative.)
- Projector and at least one microphone needed per room. 
- If a panel is scheduled, make more chairs and more microphones available. 
- Provide power cords and extra dongles for various laptop-to-video outputs for presenters.
- Provide power strips in audience for attendees. 

## Sprint Days (2 Days)

- Expected attendance: 150 - 200.
- Can book sprint venue at the same venue as the rest of the conference, but this will be the most expensive option for catering
- Can book sprint venue at an alternate venue (possibly a local tech company or coworking space will donate their space). This can be less expensive for catering, but may require attendees to travel from the hotel.

## Optional Events

See [Special Events](../experience/special_events.md) for other special event ideas. 

### Newcomer Orientation

- Cost: free 
- Schedule the evening after tutorials, or the first day of talks before the keynote 
- Presentation that lasts about 30-60 minutes and covers: 
  - Code of Conduct 
  - Impostor syndrome 
  - Self care, using the quiet room, trying to exercise the extrovert muscle 

### Other Sponsor Events

- Cost: Free for the conference
- At sponsor discretion 
- May include an evening event that they ask us to promote but we are not involved in (2018 Mini-Golf with Caktus), or a hosted lunch (2018's Women and Non-Binary Luncheon hosted by Microsoft Azuere Advocates) at the venue that we help them coordinate with venue staff but they fund.
