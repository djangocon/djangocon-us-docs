# A/V 

## Responsibilities 

- Get quotes from video recording companies 
- Manage video recording contract (but do not sign anything) 
- Communicate information about microphone types to the program and communication teams, so speakers are prepared 
- Be the point of contact for the video staff at the conference, helping debug problems as needed 

## Notes 

It's hard to say what the onsite A/V experience will be. Some years it's seamless, other years projectors may flicker or there may be mic static that needs to be dealt with. It's helpful to have a single person dedicated to responding to reports of A/V issues at the conference and who can communicate with the onsite A/V and recording teams to debug issues. 

It's helpful for the A/V person to also have a stash of dongles so that all presenters are able to plug their laptops into presentation hardware even if they don't have their own adapters.
