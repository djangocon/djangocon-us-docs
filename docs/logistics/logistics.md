## About organizing DjangoCon US

The Django Software Foundation has published [guidelines](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/conferences/) for hosting an event that is branded "DjangoCon."

The guidelines in these docs are specific to DjangoCon US, which is a two-track conference that takes place over six days in North America. If you'd like to start your own DjangoCon or other Django conference, feel free to reach out. We'll do whatever we can to help.

Some areas of responsibility come into play very early in the planning process. A website lead is needed very early on, for example. Other areas of responsibility only come into play at the conference itself, such as the registration coordinator.

The responsibilities for each area described here are meant to be comprehensive, but not necessarily exhaustive. Other to-do items will come up in the planning process; every year is different. All organizers are free to help other areas as needed.
