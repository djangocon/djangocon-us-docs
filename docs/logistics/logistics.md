# Team and Logistics 

## About organizing DjangoCon US 

Some areas of responsibility come into play very early in the planning process. A website lead is needed very early on, for example. Other areas of responsibility only come into play at the conference itself, such as the registration coordinator. The conference chair(s) are selected very early in the process.  

The list of responsibilities for each area is meant to be comprehensive, but not necessarily exhaustive. Other to-do items will come up in the planning process; every year is different. All organizers are free to help other areas as needed; organizers are not territorial about their areas. 

The Django Software Foundation has published [guidelines](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/conferences/) for hosting an event that is branded "DjangoCon."

The guidelines in this GitBook are specific to DjangoCon US, which is a two-track conference that takes place over six days in North America. 

Some unpublished rules about hosting a DjangoCon will vary depending on the location of the DjangoCon; for example, in the United States, we are required to host our event a specific amount of time away from PyCon US and DjangoCon Europe. If you would like to host a DjangoCon or another Django event, please contact the DSF for more information.
