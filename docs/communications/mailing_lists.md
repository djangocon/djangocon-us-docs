## Mass Emails

We use [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for mass emails to attendees, speakers, and sponsors. Mailchimp has pretty good [docs](https://mailchimp.com/help/) that can help you figure out how to do what you need to do. Common Mailchimp functions:

- Create lists
- Update people on lists (new ticket purchasers)
- Create new template
- Add sponsors to template
- Create "campaign" (another word for email)
- Schedule campaign

These are the current lists we use in Mailchimp:

### DjangoCon US Announcements

This is the list we use for anyone who wants notifications about our announcements. It persists from year to year. At the end of a conference, we move all attendees from the current year onto this list so they can continue to receive announcements for the following year.

### DjangoCon US Attendees

We use this list to keep in touch with attendees before and during DjangoCon US. This list is deleted at the end of a conference year.

### DjangoCon US Speakers

This is a private list with all of our speakers (keynotes, talks, and tutorials). This list is deleted at the end of a conference year.

### DjangoCon US Sponsors

This is a private list with all of our sponsors which we use to keep them informed of what's going on. This list is deleted at the end of a conference year.
