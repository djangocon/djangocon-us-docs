## Notes

For the past several years, we've collected Opportunity Grant applications in a Google form. We then export the spreadsheet to [Grorg](https://github.com/djangocon/grorg) for scoring.

To use Grorg, contact the automation channel on Slack. One of them will set up the new year's Opportunity Grants review system and give you a code. Log in or register with Grorg, then use the code to join this year's group. Upload the responses and get scoring.

We do not use Grorg to allocate Opportunity Grants; we use a separate spreadsheet for that.
