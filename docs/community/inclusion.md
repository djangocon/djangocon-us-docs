# Accessibility & Inclusion

Team Size: 1-2; all organizers

## Responsibilities

- Recruit proposal submitters to ensure a diverse speaker lineup, including actively reaching out to groups and individuals to encourage proposals, and providing sample posts/emails to other conference volunteers to aid in their recruitment
- Stay educated on the code of conduct and its enforcement. Not required to serve as a code of conduct contact, however.
- Advise program team on selection
- Score Opportunity Grant applications
- Advise Opportunity Grants team on allocation
- Ensure venue accessibility information is posted on conference website

## Notes

In the past, this position has been combined with Opportunity Grants and been its own position.

It is the responsibility of all conference organizers to ensure that diversity, inclusion, and accessibility are part of their recruitment and decision-making process; setting aside these goals in their own area of resposibility is not an attempt to make diversity one person's responsibility.
