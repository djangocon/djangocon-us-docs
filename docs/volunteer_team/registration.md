## Responsibilities

- Coordinate management of registration desk during the conference, including:
    - Distributing badges
    - Answering questions (aka being an Information Desk)
- Ensure registration desk is staffed at all times as defined in volunteer signup spreadsheet
- Ensuring registration desk is supplied with standard office supplies

## Notes

People will line up to check in about 15-30 minutes prior to the posted "open" time on the first talks day.

The tutorials day acts as a "dry run" for the first conference day.

The first day of talks is the busiest day for registration, especially the morning thereof.
