## Session Emcees

### About Session Emceeing

The session emcee role is an easy and fun way to contribute to DjangoCon. You help speakers feel welcome and ensure talks run smoothly.

### Before Your Session (15 mins early)

- Be in the talk room 15 minutes early
- Feel free to use the green room at any time during the conference
- Have your schedule and [time cards](timecards.pdf) (15/10/5/STOP)
- Read the talk description so you can give a good introduction
- Meet your speaker and ask about:
  - Pronouns and bio details to mention
  - Q&A preference (yes/no/how long)
  - Photo restrictions
  - Ask them to remove their lanyard before the talk

### During the Talk

- Track time carefully:
  - 25-minute talks = 20 mins speaking + 5 mins Q&A
  - 45-minute talks = 40 mins speaking + 5 mins Q&A
- Flash time cards at 15, 10, and 5 minutes remaining
- Pay attention and prepare 1-2 questions for Q&A

### After the Talk

- Start applause if silence hangs too long
- If doing Q&A: Stand up and ask the first question (unless someone else is already heading to the mic)
  - This breaks the ice and gives the audience time to think of questions
  - For more on why this matters, see [Russell Keith-Magee's post on asking questions](https://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-a-question-or-five/)
- Give the speaker their gift (if applicable)

### Q&A Script

> "Thank you [speaker]! We've got a few minutes for questions now, so come to the microphone if you've got one. I would ask that you use this time only for questions directed at the speaker; please save your comments for after the recorded portion of the talk."
>
> "Before we open up Q&A, we want to remind the audience to keep your questions short, on-topic, and respectful. If they're not, the speaker and Q&A moderator may cut you off or decline to answer your question."

### Managing Q&A Issues

| Issue | Script |
|-------|--------|
| Too many questions at once | "Please ask only one question at a time" |
| Comments not questions | "We're looking for questions only. Save comments for later" |
| Running long | "In the interest of time, I need to move to the next person" |

### Talk to the AV Team

Before your session, check with the AV team about:
- Which microphone to use
- Whether to move the mic stand for Q&A
- Camera positioning considerations

### If a Speaker Cannot Go On

If a speaker is unable to proceed (medical, personal, or other issue):

1. Reassure them it's okay
2. Consider these options:
   - Extended Q&A with the preceding speaker (with their permission)
   - Announce the cancellation and encourage the "hallway track"
3. Notify conference staff immediately

### Code of Conduct During Talks

**Minor violations** (e.g., a single inappropriate slide):
- Do not stop the talk
- Notify conference staff afterward for follow-up

**Major violations** (e.g., repeated derogatory remarks, pervasive inappropriate content):
- Stop the talk: "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time"
- Contact conference staff immediately
- Emergency contact: [DEFNA board member phone number]

## Session Managers

### Responsibilities

- Check that there are enough speaker gifts for your slot
- Ensure the correct speaker sheet is on top and time cards are in order
- Know who your session emcee is and confirm they're ready
- If no session emcee is assigned, you are the backup

## Online Moderator Volunteers

### Responsibilities

- Monitor public chat for disparaging comments
- Enforce the Code of Conduct
- Act as a cheerleader for speakers after talks
- Answer questions about the online portion of the conference
- Participate in social events (meet & greets, etc.)

### Staffing

- Ideally 4-8 moderators at a time (2 per track)
- Half-day shifts recommended

## Training and Communication

All volunteers should:

1. Review this handbook before the conference
2. Join the #volunteering-at-dcus Slack channel
3. Attend the volunteer orientation on Monday morning (8:00 AM at registration desk)
4. Know who to contact for questions or concerns

## Volunteer Expectations

If a volunteer fails to meet expectations (e.g., no-shows without notice, repeated issues):

- Document the issue
- If there's a reasonable excuse (illness, emergency), no action needed
- For repeated issues without explanation, make a note for future reference
