# Child Care 

Team Size: 1

## Responsibilities 

- Work with treasurer to develop budget for childcare 
- Work with DEFNA and venue liaison to confirm options for onsite childcare (usually not an option for insurance purposes) 
- Work with local volunteers to find a childcare provider 
- Work with communications to communicate childcare signup form and other relevant details 
- Make sure attendees using childcare are informed of processes 

## Notes 

In 2018, we used Destination Sitters for hotel-based childcare. Attendees booked childcare individually, then turned in their receipts to us for reimbursement. We reimbursed about $100/day. 

In 2016, we had a contact with a local childcare provider. Attendees could sign up in advance to take children 0-5 to the local childcare center; we paid the childcare center directly.
