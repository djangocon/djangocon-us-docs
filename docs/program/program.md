# Program

Team Size: 1-4

## Responsibilities

- Recruit people to submit proposals
- Write the CFP and set a deadline
- Coordinate with communication team to promote CFP
- Prepare reviewing guidelines
- Score all proposals
- Recruit reviewers from the community to help score proposals and ensure they have familiarized themselves with reviewing guidelines
- Select final proposals, keeping in mind:
- Track presenter diversity across multiple vectors (ability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, geographic location) as well as possible without collecting demographics
- Topics that need to be covered
- Coordinate with Opportunity Grants to ensure that all speakers who need aid are adequately funded
- Work with Opportunity Grants to manage any unexpected speaker grant requests
- Ensure acceptance and rejection emails are drafted
- Send acceptance and rejection notifications by deadline
- Design schedule and ensure it makes it to the website
- Advise on keynote speakers as requested
- At the conference, ensure speakers have what they need (water at podiums, microphones, etc.)
- At the conference, manage unexpected schedule changes (no-shows, ill speakers, etc.)

## Logistics

- We use [Pretalx](https://www.pretalx.com/) to accept proposals.
- We recruit reviewers from the community and add them to Pretalx as "reviewers" to let them review
- We do not discount talks for being "not Pythonic/Djangonic" enough
  - We do, however, discount talks for not being a good fit for our type of audience
- Tutorial presenters and speakers get complimentary conference passes

## Notes

When selecting the program, look for these things:

- We don't give people more than one speaking slot. If someone is presenting a tutorial, they may still give a talk under extroadinary circumstances only, but we prioritize other proposers.
- If you have two highly-rated submissions from the same speaker and that speaker is from an underrepresented group, accept the more technical talk
- Make sure the speakers from underrepresented groups aren't solely giving "soft" talks
- Talks on trendy topics tend to be highly rated. Don't accept multiple talks on the same or very similar topics; make sure to select a program that covers a wide range of topics
- It's fine to select organizers as speakers, but be wary of the program being too heavy on organizers.
- We don't accept panels where the moderator or panelists haven't been selected. We are generally wary of panels, but we have accepted them before. The program committee is welcome to organize their own panel, though.
- We will not present an all-white or all-male panel.
