Team Size: 1-4 

## Responsibilities 

- Recruit people to submit proposals 
- Write the CFP and set a deadline
- Coordinate with communication team to promote CFP 
- Prepare reviewing guidelines 
- Score all proposals 
- Recruit reviewers from the community to help score proposals and ensure they have familiarized themselves with reviewing guidelines 
- Select final proposals, keeping in mind: 
- Presenter diversity across multiple vectors (ability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, geographic location) 
- Topics that need to be covered 
- Coordinate with financial aid to ensure that all speakers who need aid are adequately funded 
- Work with financial aid to manage any unexpected speaker financial aid requests 
- Ensure acceptance and rejection emails are drafted 
- Send acceptance and rejection notifications by deadline 
- Design schedule and ensure it makes it to the website 
- Advise on keynote speakers as requested 
- At the conference, ensure speakers have what they need (water at podiums, microphones, etc.) 
- At the conference, manage unexpected schedule changes (no-shows, ill speakers, etc.) 

## Logistics 

- We use [Papercall](https://www.papercall.io/) to accept proposals. 
- We recruit reviewers from the community and add them to Papercall as "reviewers" to let them review 
- We do not discount talks for being "not Pythonic/Djangonic" enough 
- Tutorial presenters and speakers get complimentary conference passes 

## Notes 

When selecting the program, look for these things: 

- We don't give people more than one speaking slot. If someone is presenting a tutorial, they may still give a talk, but we prioritize other proposers. 
- If you have two highly-rated submissions from the same speaker and that speaker is from an underrepresented group, accept the more technical talk 
- Make sure the speakers from underrepresented groups aren't solely giving "soft" talks 
- Talks on trendy topics tend to be highly rated. Don't accept multiple talks on the same or very similar topics; make sure to select a program that covers a wide range of topics 
- It's fine to select organizers as speakers, but be wary of the program being too heavy on organizers. 
- We don't accept panels where the moderator or panelists haven't been selected. We are generally wary of panels, but we have accepted them before. 
- We will not present an all-white or all-male panel.
