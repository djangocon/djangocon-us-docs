# Program - Recruit Speaker

## Subject: DjangoCon US CFP

Dear [Person],

I'm familiar with your talk [talk] that you gave at [other conference], and I think it would be a great fit for DjangoCon US. I'd like to invite you to submit that talk (or any other talk you think would be valuable to our community) to DjangoCon US before our CFP closes on [date].

A little about DjangoCon US: We are a nonprofit conference with about 400 attendees. We're looking for diverse topics that represent the experiences of our community, not just talks on the Django web framework. We have a Code of Conduct with a response plan and Opportunity Grants are available if cost is a concern. Our CFP closes on [date]: [link to CFP].

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I'd love to see you speak at DjangoCon US! 

Warmly, 

[Your name] 

[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
