# Code of Conduct - Complaint About the Code of Conduct

## Subject: Code of Conduct at DjangoCon US  

Dear [name],

Thank you for contacting us. We are prepared in case the unforeseeable happens. We also include emergency numbers in case something happens outside of our conference because we care about our attendees well-being.

"This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate." -- [Django's Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).  I would highly recommend you check it out Django's CoC because every Django-related event follows it.

Our tech events aren't the only places which cover CoC standards. For example, [reference venue conduct standards]. 

If you have purchased a ticket and you are bothered by our inclusion of a CoC then I am more than happy to refund your ticket. 

Regards,

[Your name]

[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
