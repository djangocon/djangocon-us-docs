# Code of Conduct - About the Code of Conduct

## Subject: About the DjangoCon US Code of Conduct 

Dear [name], 

We are very proud to have a Code of Conduct for DjangoCon US [year] that covers the conference and any conference-related events. While we hope that all attendees have a safe and enjoyable time while at DjangoCon US, we recognize that we need to be prepared. We also include emergency numbers on our website in case something happens outside of our conference because we care about our attendees' well being.

If you witness or experience a violation of the Code of Conduct while at DjangoCon US, please contact [these people], who are prepared to respond to CoC violations swiftly and confidentially. More information about the Code of Conduct is on our website at [link]. 

If you have questions about our Code of Conduct, feel free to contact me at [email]. 

Warmly,

[Your name]

[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
