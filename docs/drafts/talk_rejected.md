# Program - Declined

## Subject: DjangoCon US Proposal Decision

Dear [name],

Thank you very much for your DjangoCon US talk proposal. As you may know, we had record-breaking levels of talk submissions. Sadly, we have just [number] spots on the schedule, so many excellent talks couldn't be accommodated. 

Unfortunately, your talk [talk name] was not one of the ones selected to appear at DjangoCon US [year].

I do hope you'll choose to come to DjangoCon US regardless. It's an amazing conference. You may still want to consider delivering your material as a lightning talk (quick, five-minute talks on any topic). For more information, see [link]. 

If you plan to come, you may register at [link] as soon as possible. 

If you have any other questions, comments, or feedback for us, please feel free to contact us. 

On behalf of the DjangoCon US organizer's committee, I want to thank you again for your submission. You made our job picking talks very hard, and the conference will be better for it.

I hope to see you in [city]!

Warmly, 

[Your name] 
[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
