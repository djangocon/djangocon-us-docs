# Opportunity Grants - Declined

## Subject: DjangoCon US Opportunity Grant Decision

Dear name,

Thank you for applying for the DjangoCon US [year] Opportunity Grants program. We had many deserving applicants, but unfortunately we were not able to provide grants to all who applied. We regret to inform you that you have not been selected for a grant.

We hope you're still able to attend DjangoCon US, and that we'll see you in [city]. Thank you very much for your interest in our program. 

Sincerely,

[Your name]

[Your title], DjangoCon US [year]
