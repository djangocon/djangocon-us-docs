# Experience - Why should I attend?

*Sometimes we get the question, "What can I tell my manager to help them decide to let me attend DjangoCon?" before the schedule is up.*

Dear [name], 

DjangoCon has something for everyone, from the person who develops Django applications for a living to the person who just tinkers in their spare time. Whether you're a Django expert, just started working in Django recently, or are interested in learning, we have talks and tutorials for you.

Perhaps looking at schedules from prior years would be helpful? Here is a link to the 2015 schedule: http://2015.djangocon.us/schedule We of course cannot guarantee that the same topics will be represented in our final schedule, but we generally have talks that touch on parts of the Django ecosystem that are useful to developers who use Django in all sorts of ways. 

Hope this helps,
