# Tickets

Get tickets out sooner than later.

Reserve 10% to 20% for speakers and sponsors.

Early bird tickets should provide an incentive for attendees to be buy sooner than later. Early bird tickets should be based on your covering your basic costs.

Standard tickets should be more expensive than early bird tickets but priced to cover your main conference expenses.

Late prices / day of event pricing. Since we sold out during our early bird pricing, we did not run into this.

Ticket tiers:

1. Reduced rate (Student, Diversity, and Unemployed)
2. Individual
3. Corporate
4. Volunteer-only

Ticket levels:

1. Early Bird
2. Normal pricing
3. Last-minute pricing

### How do I figure out how many tickets to sell?

Take your total venue capacity and subtract out reserved tickets for volunteers, speakers, sponsors, and diversity tickets. This is the number of tickets you'll need.

### How do I determine what our tickets should cost?

We use three basic pricing tiers with DjangoCon: reduced, individual, and corporate tiers. Our goal was to price our individual tickets just above our theoretical cost. Our break even per attendee before taxes and ticket fees was around $425 which we upped to $495 to cover these fees, taxes, and charges.

We priced our reduced rate tickets below our cost and lowered our price by $200 to $295. These tickets are intended for students and diversity groups which we want to encourage to attend our event without pricing them out of the conference. 

We priced our corporate tickets at $200 more than our individual tickets to make up the difference in what we lose when we sell a reduced rate ticket. Our corporate tickets are priced at $695. As long as we sell more corporate tickets than reduced rate tickets then we can afford to offer more reduced rate tickets.

We had a very small number of volunteer-only tickets this year. It's one of my biggest regrets that we tried to follow the "Everybody Pays" model instead of sensibly tossing it aside.

## Overselling

### Should we oversell?

Unfortunately, not everyone who buys a ticket can actually attend. Business priorities change, job situation change, last minute deadlines, family emergencies, and people get busy. 

After polling half a dozen conference organizers about what percentage of attendees will not make it everyone came back with a number around 2% to 5% or 5% to 10%. We set 5% as our goal since everyone we asked seemed to have it in mind. This is an arbitrary and completely unscientific number so use it as a guide but adjust it to fit your situation.

## Tutorials

We priced our tutorials based on previous years of $150 per tutorial. Our daily cost per attendee is $107 per person (before tax) so we decided to offer every tutorial presenter the net difference of $37 per person. In addition to the presenter's fees, we also pay for their daily ticket because it would be wrong to make someone pay to give their own tutorial.

We have a 25 person cap on each tutorial which we can go up to 30 if requested. We have two tracks of tutorials with both a morning and an afternoon session for a total of four tutorials for a given day. We were expecting 100 attendees for the day.
